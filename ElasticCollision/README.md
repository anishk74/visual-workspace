# Elastic Collision - PI
Visualization of elastic collisions between two blocks, with one's mass power of 100 times the other one's mass, traces the 
digits of PI

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes

### Prerequisites
What things you need to run the program on your machine

```
1. Processing
```
### Testing and Running
Execute the 'ElasticCollision.pde' file using processing

## Collisions with difference mass shown below

### 1 Digit of PI :: mass ratio = 1:1 :: No. of Collisions: 3
