# Gift Wrapping Algorithm
The algorithm for computing the convex hull of a given set of points, this project tries to visualize the working of the algorithm step by step.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes

### Prerequisites
What things you need to run the program on your machine

```
1. Processing
```
### Testing and Running
Execute the 'GiftWrappingAlgorithm.pde' file using processing
