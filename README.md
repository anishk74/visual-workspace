## Gift Wrapping Algorithm
* Visualize the formation of convex hull for set of points.
* Build with [Processing](https://processing.org/)
* Sample formation of convex hull, with 20 points <br>

## Tower Of Hanoi
* Visualization of "Tower of Hanoi" problem with n discs (1 <= n <= 20)
* Build with [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news)
* Sample Visualization for 6 disks <br>

## Elastic Collision
* Visualization of elastic collisions between two blocks, with one's mass power of 100 times the other one's mass, traces the 
digits of PI
* Motivated by this brilliant youtube video by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs). I wanted to see it for myself.
* Build with [Processing](https://processing.org/)
* Sample Visualization for mass ratio :: 1:100,000,000, tracing 5 digits of PI upto 31415 <br>

## Black Rain
* Formation of rain, using a little physics. I've no idea why I made this.
* This is what it looks like <br>
